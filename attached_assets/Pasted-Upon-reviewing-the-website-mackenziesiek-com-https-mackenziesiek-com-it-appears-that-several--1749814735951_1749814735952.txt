Upon reviewing the website [mackenziesiek.com](https://mackenziesiek.com/), it appears that several images and items are not displaying correctly, indicating potential issues with broken image links or related problems.

### Common Causes of Broken Images

Broken images can result from various issues, including:

* **Incorrect File Paths or URLs**: If the image source paths in the HTML are incorrect or misspelled, browsers won't be able to locate and display them. ([alexhost.com][1])

* **Case Sensitivity on Servers**: On servers that are case-sensitive (like many Linux servers), referencing `Image.jpg` instead of `image.jpg` can lead to broken images. ([alexhost.com][1])

* **Missing or Deleted Files**: If image files have been moved or deleted from the server without updating the corresponding HTML, the images will not load. ([sitechecker.pro][2])

* **Permission Issues**: If the server's file permissions prevent public access to image files, browsers won't be able to display them.&#x20;

* **Mixed Content (HTTP vs. HTTPS)**: Loading images over HTTP on an HTTPS site can cause browsers to block them for security reasons.&#x20;

### Steps to Identify and Fix Broken Images

1. **Inspect Image Elements**:

   * Use browser developer tools (right-click on the broken image and select "Inspect") to check the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag. Ensure the path is correct and the file exists at that location. ([link-assistant.com][3])

2. **Check Server File Structure**:

   * Verify that the image files are present in the specified directories on the server and that their names match exactly, considering case sensitivity.&#x20;

3. **Review File Permissions**:

   * Ensure that image files have the appropriate permissions set to allow public access (typically `644` for files and `755` for directories). ([sitechecker.pro][2])

4. **Update Insecure URLs**:

   * If the site uses HTTPS, make sure all image URLs also use HTTPS to prevent mixed content issues. ([diffusedigitalmarketing.com][4])

5. **Utilize Automated Tools**:

   * Employ tools like [Sitechecker's Broken Image Checker](https://sitechecker.pro/broken-image-checker/) or [WebSite Auditor](https://www.link-assistant.com/news/fixing-broken-images.html) to scan the website for broken images and obtain detailed reports for remediation.([link-assistant.com][3])

### Implementing Fixes Using Replit

If you're using Replit to host or develop your website, follow these steps:

1. **Access Your Project**:

   * Open your Replit project where the website code resides.([guidingtech.com][5])

2. **Verify Image Paths**:

   * In your HTML files, check the `src` attributes of `<img>` tags to ensure they point to the correct file paths.

3. **Upload Missing Images**:

   * If any image files are missing, upload them to the appropriate directories within your Replit project.

4. **Adjust File Permissions**:

   * While Replit manages file permissions automatically, ensure that your files are placed in directories that are publicly accessible.

5. **Test the Website**:

   * Use Replit's preview feature to test your website and confirm that all images load correctly.

6. **Deploy Changes**:

   * Once verified, deploy your changes to make them live.

By systematically addressing these areas, you should be able to resolve the broken image issues on your website.
